How to speed up your clojure build by 10x with boot and ramdisk
---------------------------------------------------------------

For those us who do not fancy forking and patching clojure with CLJ-703, CLJ-322
and other compilation improvement patches for building your own projects, which
are becoming a aot compilation slug, here is a trick to speed up the compilation
many folds. I have seen a speed up of 11x in a moderately size project of my own.

The basic idea is to make all intermediate build files go to a disk space create
on ram.

This setup is for boot. boot is awesome! Go get from http://boot-clj.com/
A few words about boot first. So boot is this new powerful build tooling for
clojure which has concepts of immutable file sets. In simple words it compiles
files to a temporary location before actually writing them to the target path.

This is perfect for the ramdisk setup we are going to try.

First (and last) lets set up a moderately size ramdisk and make boot write the
filesets to ramdisk. You may need sudo.

mkdir -p /mnt/ramdisk
mount -t tmpfs -o size=128m tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk
mkdir -p /mnt/ramdisk/tmp
rm -r ~/.boot/cache/tmp
ln -s /mnt/ramdisk/tmp ~/.boot/cache/tmp

You are done!

Probably would need some more work to make this persist across restarts though.
